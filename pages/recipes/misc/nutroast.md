## Method

Heat the oven to 180C (fan 160C/gas 4) and line the base and sides of a 1.5 litre loaf tin with parchment paper.
  
Heat 1 tbsp olive oil and 15g butter in a large frying pan and cook 1 finely
chopped large onion and 2 finely chopped celery sticks for about 5 mins until
beginning to soften.
  
Stir in 2 finely chopped garlic cloves and 200g finely chopped chestnut mushrooms
and cook for a further 10 mins.
  
Stir in 1 finely diced red pepper and 1 grated carrot and cook for about 3 mins
then add 1 tsp dried oregano and 1 tsp smoked paprika and cook for just a minute.
  
Add 100g red lentils and 2 tbsp tomato pur  and cook for about 1 min, then add
300ml vegetable stock and simmer over a very gentle heat until all the liquid has
been absorbed and the mixture is fairly dry. This should take about 25 minutes.
Set aside to cool.
  
Finally, stir in 100g fresh breadcrumbs, 150g chopped mixed nuts, 3 lightly
beaten large eggs, 100g grated mature cheddar, a handful of finely chopped
flat-leaf parsley and a pinch of salt and some ground black pepper.
  
Stir to mix well then spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and press down the
surface.
  
Cover with foil and bake for 30 mins, then remove the foil and bake for a further
20 mins until firm when pressed gently.
  
Meanwhile, to make the sauce, heat 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil very gently then
add 2 finely sliced garlic cloves and 1 rosemary sprig and heat without
colouring.
  
Pour in 400ml passata and add a pinch of salt and some ground black
pepper. Simmer gently for just 15 mins.
  
Allow the loaf to cool in the tin for about 10 mins then turn out onto a serving
board or plate. Remove the baking paper and cut into slices and serve with a
little of the tomato sauce.
  
To make a vegan nut roast, use an extra tbsp of oil in place of butter, no cheese
and 3 tbsp egg replacer. Bake your nut roast for 1 hour. The loaf will still be
soft in the middle after cooking.
  
It can be cooked in advance and then chilled, sliced and reheated to make it
easier to serve.
